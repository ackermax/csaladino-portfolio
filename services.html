                            1 hour. Engagement and couple shoots have a special place in my heart. I love being able to take

                            of your choice. I will work with you ahead of time to pick a location that will best capture

                        <p><b>MATERNITY SESSION:</b> Maternity photo shoots last a minimum of 1 hour. Pregnancy is such a beautiful time. It is my job to help you capture this exciting time in your family’s life. Maternity sessions can take place at an outdoor location of your choice or inside your home. We will work together to decide on wardrobe and location ahead of time. The best time to photograph maternity pictures is between 32 to 36 weeks.  So it is important to book your session well in advance so you are able to secure your date. Please contact me about pricing and to book your session.  </p>

                        <p><b>NEWBORN SESSION:</b> Newborn Photo shoots will last a minimum of two hours.  Since I am a natural light photographer I do not offer studio portrait sessions. Instead I use the natural light found within the comfort of your own home to capture your little bundle of joy. I think it is important that Mom and Dad get in front of the camera so, we will take several full family shots within the session as well. Contact me for pricing and to book your session. When you book a Newborn Photo shoot with CSaladino Photography you will receive 10% off a Family shoot for your child’s first birthday.</p>
